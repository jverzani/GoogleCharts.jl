GoogleCharts

Julia interface to Google Chart Tools.



A Google chart involves basically four steps:

* a specification of a Google "DataTable"
* a specification of chart options
* a call to make the type of chart desired.
* a call to draw the chart

This package allows this to be done within `julia` by

* mapping a `DataFrame` object into a Google DataTable. 

* mapping a Dict of options into a JSON object of chart options

* providing various constructors to make the type of chart

* providing a `render` method to draw the chart (or charts) to an
  IOStream, a file or to a page in a local web browser. 

A basic usage (see the test/ directory for more)

```
using GoogleCharts, DataFrames

scatter_data = DataFrame(quote
    Age    = [8,  4,   11, 4, 3,   6.5]
    Weight = [12, 5.5, 14, 5, 3.5, 7  ]
end)

options = {:title => "Age vs. Weight comparison",
           :hAxis =>  {:title => "Age", 
                       :minValue => 0, 
                       :maxValue => 15},	
           :vAxis =>  {:title => "Weight", 
                       :minValue => 0, 
                       :maxValue => 15}
}

chart = scatter_chart(scatter_data, options);

render(chart)   ## displays in browser. 
```


There are constructors for the following charts (cf. https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery ):

```
       area_chart, bar_chart, bubble_chart, candlestick_chart, column_chart, combo_chart,
       gauge_chart, geo_chart, line_chart, pie_chart, scatter_chart, stepped_area_chart,
       table_chart, tree_chart, annotated_time_line, intensity_map, motion_chart, org_chart,
       image_spark_line
```

The helper function `help_on_chart("chart_name")` will open Google's documentation for the specified chart in a local browser.


The names of the data frame are used by the various charts. The order
of the columns is important to the charting tools. The "Data Format"
section of each web page describes this. We don't have a mechanism in
place supporting Google's "Column roles".

The options are specified through a `Dict` which is translated into
JSON by `JSON.to_json`. There are *numerous* options described in the
"Configuration Options" section of each chart's web page. Some useful
ones are shown in the example to set labels for the variables and the
viewport. Google charts seem to like integer ranges in the viewports by default.

In the `tests/` subdirectory is a file with implementations with this
package of the basic examples from Google's web pages. Some additional
examples of configurations can be found there.

The `render` method can draw a chart to an IOStream, a specified
filename, or (when used as above) to a web page that is displayed
locally. One can specify more than one chart at a time using a vector
of charts. We have defined the `show` method to render the chart in
the browser.

### A plot function

There is a `plot` function for plotting functions with a similar interface as `Gadfly`'s `plot` function:

```
plot(sin, 0, 2pi)
```

A vector of functions:

```
plot([sin, u -> cos(u) > 0 ? 0 : NaN], 0, 2pi, {:lineWidth=>5, 
	                                        :title=>"A function and where its derivative is positive",
						:vAxis=>{:minValue => -1.2, :maxValue => 1.2}
						})
```

The `plot` function uses a `line_chart`. The above example shows that `NaN` values are handled gracefully, unlike `Inf` values, which we replace with `NaN`.

Plot also works for paired vectors:

```
x = linspace(0, 1., 20)
y = rand(20)
plot(x, y)			         # dot-to-dot plot
plot(x, y, {:curveType => "function"})   # smooths things out
```

### scatter plots

The latter shows that `plot` assumes your data is a discrete
approximation to a function. For scatterplots, the `scatter`
convenience function is given. A simple use might be:

```
x = linspace(0, 1., 20)
y = rand(20)
scatter(x, y)
```

If the data is in a data frame format we have a interface like:

```
using RDatasets
mtcars = data("datasets", "mtcars")
scatter(:wt, :mpg, mtcars)
```

And we can even use with `groupby` objects:

```
iris = data("datasets", "iris")
d=iris[:, [2,3,6]]          ## in the order  "x, y, grouping factor"
gp = groupby(d, :Species)
scatter(gp)                 ## in R this would be plot(Sepal.Width ~ Sepal.Length, iris, col=Species)
                            ## or ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, color=Species)) + geom_point()
```

### TODO

The `googleVis` package for `R` does a similar thing, but has more
customizability. This package should try and provide similar
features. In particular, the following could be worked on:

* Needs a julian like interface, 
* some features for interactive usage,
* some integration with local web server.
